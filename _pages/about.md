## About Me
I am **Shih-Ming He **, currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University (CYCU), Taiwan.  
My research focuses on **2D semiconductor materials**, **scalable CVD/MOCVD process development**, and **large-area transfer techniques for device applications**.

## Research Interests
- 2D materials: Graphene, TMD (MoS₂, WS₂, etc), hBN, Janus materials
- Scalable transfer and integration
- CVD/MOCVD platforms
- AI-driven synthesis & autonomous process optimization
